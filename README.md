This is a data analysis project that examines metadata 
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met)'s vast collection of artifacts. 

Key questions this project attempts to answer include:
1. What geographic regions, time periods, and media are represented?
2. How clear is the provenance data?  What do any gaps in this data suggest?
3. How diverse is the collection in terms of gender, culture, and historical period?
4. What patterns emerge in the subjects or themes across the artifacts?
5. What types of artworks are more likely to be exhibited vs. kept in storage?
6. How can close analysis of museum data inform the educational value of its collections?
In turn, how do educational narratives affect how curators and guests perceive the collections?

7. This project also discusses the importance of and growing calls for 
decolonization of museums and repatriation of artifacts. The Met in particular
has been embroiled in considerable scandal recently, bringing the serious issue
of stolen and illegally acquired antiquities into stark relief.
