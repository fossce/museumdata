
This is a data analysis project that explores, cleans, visualizes, and compares data from museum collections, 
including the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). 

Key questions this project attempts to answer include:
1. What geographic regions, time periods, and media are represented in these collections?
2. How clear is the provenance data in each collection? What do any gaps in this data suggest?
3. How diverse is each collection in terms of gender, culture, and historical period?
4. What patterns emerge in the subjects or themes across collected artworks?
5. What types of artworks are more likely to be on display in a gallery vs. kept in storage?
6. How can close analysis of museum data enrich the educational value of its collections?

In light of recent controversies surrounding stolen and illegally acquired artifacts,
this project also hopes to emphasize the importance of accuracy and due diligence 
in maintaining digital records of museum data.
