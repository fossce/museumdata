    "### Geographical Data\n",
    "The Met's classification system features naming conventions that reflect the era during which the artifacts were acquired, but many geographical locations referenced in the metadata either no longer exist or have been renamed. This complicates data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "A standard naming convention was generated based on presently existing countries and nationalitiees, and this data was added to a new series of columns that follow a naming convention using the suffix '_cc' for 'contemporary classification'. For example, if an artifact contained the word \"Swaziland\" in its original 'country' column, I added 'Eswatini' to the 'country_cc' column, since this is the name that the Kingdom of Swaziland assumed in 2018, 50 years after it gained independence from British rule that had lasted from 1903-1968. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is helpful for mapping the origins of the Met's collections, but it does cause issues for analyzing artifacts from regions that today contain multiple countries, like former Yugoslavia. If a city or province is not included in the geographic data, it is challenging to classify the artifact in a way that offers both contemporary context and cultural respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API's geographic data raises larger concerns as well. The Met provides sample analytics of its API data on Google BigQuery, but these queries focus on gender, medium, and year, which are attributes with more complete information, while geographic data is often lacking. Geographic and cultural data also contain occasional typographical errors and irregularities, which, I addressed using regular expressions during data cleaning. However, like applying contemporary names to historical regions, fixing misspellings or standardizing content by nationality is difficult for a collection in the millions and has a tendency to erase nuances of region and culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the amount of controversy the Met has faced over stolen artifacts, and the obscure provenance for many items acquired during colonial periods, this discrepancy in API data is concerning."

    "### Media & Materials Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While data regarding media and classfication is more comprehensive and less error-prone than the geographic data, the 'classification' column has more missing values than the 'objectName' and 'medium' columns. However, it uses simpler, more consistent terms, like 'prints,' and 'books' compared to the other 2 columns' descriptive but unique values, making it challenging to provide a straightforward analysis of art media used throughout the collection. Therefore, the values from all 3 columns will be cross-referenced."

    "3. Why do materials and classification columns have fewer typographical errors than the geographic columns? Were the data entered by different people? If not, what accounts for this discrepancy?"
